## Inspiration

Our first time doing a hardware hack and it was great learning experience doing a full stack project.

## What it does

Students can enter their notes on our web app and it will be stored in a database. These notes are be stored in a database and can be queried by Amazon Echo.

## How we built it

Built mainly in AWS, using API gateway, lambda functions and Alexa

## Challenges we ran into

First time using hardware, and learning the incredibly complex syntax. Also many GET/POSTS requests were made.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The echo talks back to us with what we want to hear

## What we learned

Many aspects of javascript/python, especially with functions that have many dependencies

## What's next for EchoMyNotes

Wherever the wind takes us
